# The Design of the Log Component

# According to the requirements, we can define an ILog class and define three functions: 
# 1. write()
# 2. createNewFile()
# 3. stop()

# Throughout the process, we can use a queue to store the logs, 
# and create a background thread to continuously write logs in the queue to the output file.
# In this case, we are able to handle the write request as fast as possible.

# For the write() function, we directly add the log information to the queue and then exit. 
# The background thread will continuously write the log in the queue to the current log file,
# and it would not block the write() function.

# For the createNewFile() function, we can set a timer at midnight.
# Because we set the timer, we donâ€™t need to judge the arrival time of log every time.
# Whenever at midnight, the module will immediately create a new queue and a new log file. 
# Newly arrived log information will be added to the new queue. 
# The background process will continuously output the previous day's log information to the old log file. 
# When the old queue has been emptied, the background process will transfer to the new queue, 
# update the write file to the latest log file, and then start outputting log information from the new queue.

# We can use only one queue, like get the size of the queue at the last second of the previous day and output those logs to old log file.

# For the stop function, we handle it in two cases: 
# The first is to terminate immediately. At this time, the background thread stops immediately. 
# And the queue doesn't enqueue any new arrival log infos.
# The second is to wait for all logs in the queue to be written out before terminating. 
# In this case, our queue no longer accepts new log messages and stops when the queue is empty.

# We use try and except to handle the errors.

# The above is the basic design of the log module, but due to time constraints, I was not able to complete the coding part.
# So there are some bugs in the following codes and the unittests, which I wish I was supposed to fix it.
